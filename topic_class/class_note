#what is a class?
namespace? then what's exactly in the namespace?
for multithreading, does it mean all private and public data member are shared between different function member thread? and mutex and lock will lock all data member from access.
it's command that function member access data member, if mutex prevent that happpening simultaneously, then what's the point of using multithreading in a class?
